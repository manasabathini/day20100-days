# What can range *really* do?

Give range one number, and it will count up to that number. However, you can actually give the range function a few options...
- **starting value:** what number do you want to start with?
- **ending value:** the number *after* the number you want to end with (example: if you type 10 as the ending value, the computer will count until 9)
- **increment:** How much should it increase by every time it loops? (example: Do you want to count by 1s, 5s, 10s?)

**The ending value has an unsaid 'less than'. Meaning the computer will stop one number before the ending number that is written in the range.**

### Let's try some examples.
